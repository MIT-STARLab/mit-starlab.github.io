The Space Telecommunications, Astronomy and Radiation Laboratory, led by [Prof. Kerri Cahoy](https://aeroastro.mit.edu/people/kerri-cahoy/), is part of the Space Systems Laboratory in the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics at MIT.

We welcome interest from exceptional graduate students enthusiastic about space exploration and advancing satellite technology. Students who have already been admitted into AeroAstro, EECS, MechE, EAPS, or Physics may contact Prof. Cahoy (response time varies with time of year). For all questions about MIT graduate admissions, please contact the department graduate admissions coordinator Rachael Draper (rdraper[at]mit[dot]edu).

The AeroAstro faculty, students, and staff affirm a commitment to protect and nurture the mental and physical well-being of each member of our community. A core value of our department is a commitment to diversity, which connotes an awareness and acceptance of the value and strength derived from engaging the richness of multiple cultures including race, disabilities, gender, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, and skin color, among other attributes. The full potential and impact of our scholarship, teaching and learning, knowledge creation, innovation, and service can only be realized in an environment where people are supported and valued for their humanity, without prejudice, and where inclusion, collaboration, and sharing are core principles. At STAR Lab, we specialize in designing state-of-the-art technology for space applications and we recognize that our lab and the aerospace field in general cannot reach its full potential until everyone has equal opportunity and access to contribute.
